### This is the second tab

```{r}

# calculating medians
playlist_medians <- bigmusicmountain %>% 
  summarise(across(c(danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, 
                     acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo), median))

playlist_medians_table <- playlist_medians %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "variable", values_to = "median")
playlist_medians_table

# calculating means
playlist_means <- bigmusicmountain %>% 
  summarise(across(c(danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, 
                     acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo), mean))

playlist_means_table <- playlist_means %>%
  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = "variable", values_to = "mean")
playlist_means_table

```

### New tab

```{r}

# Calculate Euclidean distance for each song
bigmusicmountain_dist <- bigmusicmountain %>% 
  mutate(dist = sqrt((danceability - playlist_medians$danceability)^2 +
                       (energy - playlist_medians$energy)^2 +

                       (loudness - playlist_medians$loudness)^2 +
                       (mode - playlist_medians$mode)^2 +
                       (speechiness - playlist_medians$speechiness)^2 +

                       (tempo - playlist_medians$tempo)^2))

# Sort by distance and select first row (i.e., song with smallest distance)
most_average_song <- bigmusicmountain_dist %>% 
  arrange(dist) %>% 
  slice(1)

least_average_song <- bigmusicmountain_dist %>%

### Violin

```{r}

# violin plot with valence
bigmusicmountain |>
  ggplot(aes(x = playlist_name, y=valence))+
    geom_violin()

```
