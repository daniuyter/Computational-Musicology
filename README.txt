# Computational-Musicology

For my corpus, i have chosen my own personal playlist called: Big Music Mountain. It is basically a (~550 song long) playlist with the songs I like most across all genres. Basically every song I come across and really like are included in it. 
I chose this playlist as my corpus because it represents my own taste in music really well, and I hope to gain some insights into that by analyzing it.

The playlist mostly consists of my selection of good songs per album (or entire albums if all songs are good), so inside these albums there will be similarities, but across the albums there will be some differences, however, parts of the playlist are pretty similar (a Dire Straits album vs a Doors album will have some similarities in genre). 
99% of my music listening takes place on spotify, there are only a few songs I listen to on YouTube sometimes because they are either live or not on Spotify.

Because the playlist mostly includes songs by Dire Straits, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jimi Hendrix, I think Castles Made of Sand is a pretty typical song in the list, as it is originally played by Jimi Hendrix, but covered by the Peppers. It sounds a little like a Dire Straits song too, and the text is in a similar style to that of the Dire Straits. Some very atypical songs are mostly 'guilty' pleasures, like Blue Monday and Young Guns by Wham.
