<h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>
<p>For my corpus, i have chosen my own personal playlist: <strong>Big
Music Mountain</strong>. It is basically a (~600 song) playlist with the
songs I like most across all genres. Basically every song I come across
and really like is included in it. I chose this playlist as my corpus
because it represents my own taste in music really well, and I hope to
gain some insights into that by analyzing the Big Music Mountain.</p>
<p>The playlist mostly consists of my selection of good songs per album
(or entire albums if all songs are good), so inside these albums there
will be similarities, but across the albums there will be some
differences. However, parts of the playlist are pretty similar (a Dire
Straits album vs a Doors album will have quite some similarities).</p>
<p>Big Music Mountain mostly consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>(Alternative / Psychedelic) Rock</strong> (Jimi Hendrix,
Parquet Courts, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Tame Impala)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indie</strong> (Sticky Fingers, Mako Road, Dope Lemon,
Jungle)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reggae</strong> (Bob Marley, Billie Boyo,
Eek-A-Mouse)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blues</strong> (Dire Straits, The Doors, Tony Joe
White)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Country</strong> (America, Canned Heat)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Funk &amp; R&amp;B</strong> (Curtis Mayfield, James
Brown)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Latin &amp; African</strong> (Manu Chao, Amanaz, William
Onyeabor)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this project I will review my own taste in music through the
Spotify API and various other analysis tools, and hope to gain new
insights into which types of music I like, and why I like them.</p>
<p>The playlist can be explored on the bottom of this page!</p>

<h3>How do we find the most typical and atypical songs for the Big Music
Mountain playlist?</h3>
<p>What are the most typical and atypical songs in the Big Music
Mountain playlist?</p>
<p>My guess would be, because a large portion of the playlist are songs
by Dire Straits, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Jimi Hendrix, that Castles
Made of Sand is a pretty typical song in the list, as it is originally
played by Jimi Hendrix, but covered by the Peppers. It sounds a little
like a Dire Straits song too, and the text is in a similar style to that
of the Dire Straits. Some very atypical songs are mostly ‘guilty’
pleasures, like Blue Monday and Young Guns by Wham.</p>
<p>However, this is all based on gut feeling, from which we can’t really
conclude facts. So how do we find typical and atypical songs in a
playlist?</p>
<p><a
href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features">Spotify
keeps track of numerous features for every song on their platform,</a>
which allows us to analyze the songs in our playlists! These features
are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Acousticness</strong>: A confidence measure from 0.0 to
1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the
track is acoustic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Danceability</strong> describes how suitable a track is
for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo,
rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0
is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Energy</strong>: Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and
represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically,
energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal
has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.
Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic
range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general
entropy.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instrumentalness</strong>: Predicts whether a track
contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental
in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The
closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the
track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to
represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value
approaches 1.0.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key</strong>: The key the track is in. Integers map to
pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 =
D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Liveness</strong>: Detects the presence of an audience in
the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability
that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong
likelihood that the track is live.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loudness</strong>: The overall loudness of a track in
decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and
are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the
quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of
physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0
db.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mode</strong>: Mode indicates the modality (major or
minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is
derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Speechiness</strong>: Speechiness detects the presence of
spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording
(e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute
value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely
of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may
contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including
such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music
and other non-speech-like tracks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tempo</strong>: The overall estimated tempo of a track in
beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or
pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat
duration.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Valence</strong>: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing
the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence
sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with
low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The first step will be to calculate what the average (mean) and
median values of the Spotify features are for the entire playlist. This
gives a good first look at what an average song for the Big Music
Mountain sounds like to Spotify, based on the 11 features listed above.
These features will be used a lot in this entire project, so it is good
to understand them well!</p>
<p>The median and mean values of the features can be seen in the tables
on the right hand side of this page.</p>

<hr />
<p>In order to visualize the distribution of features in the Big Music
Mountain playlist, I have made a violin plot for each feature, in which
the distribution of values can be seen. In a violin plot, the width of
the body at a certain point is relative to how often that value is found
in the data.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through a few of these plots to get a better idea of the
distribution of feature values in the Big Music Mountain!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Danceability</strong>, <strong>valence</strong>,
<strong>loudness</strong> and <strong>energy</strong>: In each of these
plots, we see that they are somewhat similar to each other, which is
logical because these features are dependent on one another. We can see
that overall, songs in the playlist are quite danceable, often positive,
have high energy and are quite loud.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acousticness</strong>, <strong>instrumentalness</strong>
and <strong>speechiness</strong>: In these plots we see a thin body at
the top, and a broad body at the bottom, meaning that songs in the
playlist aren’t often acoustic, instrumental or ‘speechy’. We can also
see that these features are somewhat correlated to each other, which
makes sense too, since acoustic songs are often instrumental
too.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Key</strong> &amp; <strong>Mode</strong>: These plots
don’t really give us valuable information, only that mode is quite
uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, with a slight tendency towards 1
(major). Key has a broad body in most places, except for key 3 (D# /
Eb), which actually corresponds to the <a
href="https://www.jmlmusic.no/blog/most-popular-keys-in-songwriting">least
common key in music</a>, which interestingly also is D# / Eb.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The next step in our process of finding the most (a)typical song in
the Big Music Mountain playlist is to find out which song’s features are
the closest to the median values.</p>
</div>
<div

<h3>Which songs are the most typical and atypical for the Big Music
Mountain playlist?</h3>
<p>To find which song is most typical for the Big Music Mountain, and
therefore also for my taste in music, I have calculated the Euclidean
distance from each song’s features to the median value for that feature,
and added these up. Then the smallest distance can be read off for the
most typical song, and the highest distance for the most atypical song.
I have made a top 3 for typical and atypical songs.</p>
<p>I have chosen to only include the variables which range from 0-1,
because a variable like tempo can range from (e.g.) 60 to 180, and
therefore weigh in much stronger. I have tried scaling the variables
that don’t range from 0-1, but found that the results were less accurate
to my actual music taste.</p>
<p>Here is what I have found!</p>

<hr />
<p>Let’s have a closer look at the most typical and atypical songs in
the playlist. As we can see, actually most of the songs in both the
typical and atypical songs are from Dire Straits, which is interesting
because it shows they have a wide variety of songs in very different
styles. The atypical songs <strong>Private Investigations</strong> and
<strong>Brothers In Arms</strong> are probably atypical because they are
both very long, slow, mostly instrumental songs.</p>
<p>In this plot, we see the values of each audio feature (the ones that
range from 0-1 to keep the scales from getting out of hand) for the top
3 typical songs for the Big Music Mountain, and the top 3 atypical
songs. The (black-surrounded) white dots represent the median values for
each feature.</p>
<p><br />
Firstly, for the typical songs <strong>In The Gallery, One Of These
Nights</strong> and <strong>Money For Nothing</strong> we can see that
the audio features are quite average, around the median values for the
features, whereas the atypical songs <strong>Brothers In Arms, Private
Investigations</strong> and <strong>Green Onions</strong> have a much
greater distance to the median. If we take valence as an example, we see
that Brothers In Arms and Private Investigations fall in the same
category of low valence songs, whereas Green Onions is an outlier in the
sense that it’s valence is extremely high.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to point out is that Brothers In Arms is
actually my favorite song of all time (Private Investigations is also up
there), while it shows up as one of the most atypical songs in my
playlist, so the most typical song in your playlist doesn’t have to be
your favorite song (the contrary in my case!).</p>

<hr />
<p>A chromagram provides a way to visualize the presence of different
musical notes in an audio signal, in which the magnitude of the presence
of each note is indicated with yellower shades. It basically shows you
which notes are present in each part of a song, in which these parts can
be split up in different segments, sections or bars.</p>
<p>The chromagram pictured here is that of Private Investigations by
Dire Straits which, as we saw from my previous analysis, was one of the
most atypical songs in my playlist and therefore an interesting outlier
to analyse. Before we dive into the chromagram, I will provide a little
background on the song itself.</p>
<p>Private Investigations is a rock song, released by (one of my
favorite bands) Dire Straits in 1982, from the album Love Over Gold. It
is a long song (6:45), in which the beginning is very quiet and soft,
after which it slowly gets more intense as more instruments are added,
such as (bass) guitar, drums, piano and synthesizers.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the chromagram now! I have marked several sections in
the chromagram that are interesting to look at more closely.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Section 1</strong> (0:00-0:51): This is the introduction
of the song. It is a gentle piano part with a dark synthesizer sound
playing a single note in the background. We can see from the chromagram
that this note is E. The sporadic piano notes can be seen as greenish
shades in the plot.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Section 2</strong> (0:51-3:49): This is the middle part
of the song, in which more instruments slowly start playing, and vocals
come in. It starts with an acoustic guitar playing the song’s theme once
and then more instruments start following this theme. We can see that a
theme is repeated several times from the chromagram; especially B, A, G,
D and C# are played alternatingly during this part, which are notes from
the B minor scale, coinciding with the key of the song.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Section 3</strong> (3:49-5:24): After the middle part,
the instrumental theme ends with a loud bass E note, repeating slowly
throughout the section as more instruments play sporadic themes. This
section looks really similar to the first section, except that it has
more small different notes, which are the acoustic and electric guitar,
along with some other instruments.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Section 4</strong> (5:24-5:45): This section is a little
special, because the chromagram doesn’t really tell us which notes are
present, it looks like all of them are somewhat present, but with low
magnitudes. This is because this part is actually quiet, with only a few
percussion instruments playing very softly. Percussion instruments
usually play a sound that includes a lot of frequencies, so they tend to
show up across all notes in a chromagram.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Section 5</strong> (5:45-6:45): This is the outro, which
once again is very similar to the introduction and third part. The same
instruments are playing, and the song slowly fades to an end over a low
E bass note.</p></li>

<h3>Castles Made Of Sand - Jimi Hendrix / Red Hot Chili Peppers</h3>

<hr />
<p>Another interesting song in my corpus is Castles Made Of Sand,
because this is the only song that occurs twice in the Big Music
Mountain. The original version is by Jimi Hendrix, recorded in 1967, and
the Red Hot Chili Peppers covered it as a bonus track in their album
Blood Sugar Sex Magik in 1991. The Chili Peppers album actually has
another Jimi Hendrix cover; Little Miss Lover. The guitarist of the Red
Hot Chili Peppers, <a
href="https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/john-frusciante-explains-why-jimi-hendrix-is-the-greatest-guitarist-of-all-time/">John
Frusciante, is greatly influenced by Jimi Hendrix</a> (calling him the
greatest guitar player of all time), which is recognizable if you listen
to both of their songs. They have very similar styles of guitar
playing.</p>
<p>I have made a chromagram of both songs to analyse what similarities
and differences they have.</p>
<p>In the Red Hot Chili Peppers cover version, the song is slowed down a
bit in respect to Jimi’s version, which we can see by the chromagram
being a bit longer. There is one point in the song though (marked with
the red bars) where the Chili Peppers speed up a lot for around 20
seconds, which is visible in the chromagram by the shorter intervals of
the yellow bars.</p>
<p>The second thing that appeared to me was that it isn’t entirely clear
which key the Jimi Hendrix version is in. It looks like either G or F#,
whereas the Chili Peppers version is clearly in F#. Jimi Hendrix
famously tuned his guitar a half step down, so instead of the standard
tuning E A D G B E, he often used Eb Ab Db Gb Bb Eb. I know from the
guitar chords that the song is in F#, so I assume the recording quality
of Jimi’s version is a little lower, resulting in less clearly
emphasised notes. The Red Hot Chili peppers version has a 20+ year
advantage on production technology, so sounds more compressed and
clear.</p>
<p>The same chord progression can be seen in both songs, with a strong
emphasis on the notes F#, G#, E, Eb and C#.</p>
<p>Whereas in Jimi’s version, the ending doesn’t have emphasis on
specific notes, we see in the Peppers’ version that the chromagram very
clearly displays the key Gb, along with some C#. They actually play the
same outro, but Jimi’s version has more feedback, which probably caused
it to smear out the frequencies across all notes.</p>

<h1>Cepstogram</h1>

<hr />
<p>A cepstrogram is a different kind of audio-analysis visualisation, in
which timbre features are plotted over time. These features aren’t
really well known, but we know that the c01 coefficient corresponds to
loudness, c02 to bright tones, c03 to mid range tones. After this the
coefficients get a little hard to put into words. In this case I have
chosen to split the time steps up in sections.</p>
<p>In this plot we see the cepstogram of Pompette, by Dutch band Jungle
By Night. It is an instrumental song with a lot of different
instruments. We see that a lot of the timbre coefficients are present in
this song, which is most likely due to the large amount of instruments
with different timbre, all producing very different sounds.</p>
<p>There is one very interesting part of the cepstogram, from around
220-250 seconds, in which we see most the most present timbre
coefficient jump from c01 to c02. c01 corresponds with loudness and in
this part there is a somewhat quiet percussion solo, explaining why the
c01 coefficient is less present here. The c02 coefficient corresponding
to bright tones is clear here, as the percussion instrument plays a high
tone.</p>
<p>The outro of the song is a synthesizer playing a scale repeatedly,
which also causes the timbre coefficients to switch up a bit.</p>

<hr />
<p>In this plot we see the energy plotted against the logarithm of the
acousticness for songs in the Big Music Mountain. The dots all represent
songs, with the size of the dots representing instrumentalness and the
color valence. I also plotted a smoothed curve across the data, in which
a clear relationship can be seen across the accousticness / energy data,
that when a song gets more acoustic, the energy tends to get lower. I
think this relationship is quite logical, as acoustic songs are often
slower and less noisy.</p>
<p>The second relationship that can be seen in the plot, is that the
lower the dots get, the darker they tend to be. This means that the
lower the songs are in energy, the lower the valence tends to be. This
means that low energy songs are often more negative/sadder.</p>

<hr />
<p>In this plot we see a k-means clustering algorithm that has been
applied to the Big Music Mountain playlists.</p>
<p>Firstly the audio features have been normalised (scaled from 0-1), in
order to make the results more accurate. I have chosen k=3 clusters,
because this gave me the most clear results; higher values for k
resulted in unclear clusters, and lower values will underfit. Then I
plotted the results, with danceability on the x-axis, and energy on the
y-axis to visualise the clusters.</p>
<p>We can see that the k-means algorithm has divided the playlist in 3
clear groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cluster 1</strong> (red): These are high energy / low
danceability songs. Songs in this cluster include a lot of Red Hot Chili
Peppers and Jimi Hendrix songs, as well as some Tame Impala and Steely
Dan; artists who are known for producing high energy songs. These are
often songs that are loud and fast, but not really danceable. Cluster 1
almost exclusively consists of rock songs.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster 2</strong> (green): These are the low-middle energy
/ average danceable songs. This cluster includes songs like Landslide by
Fleetwood Mac and several low-tempo Dire Straits and The Doors songs.
Cluster 2 consists mosty of soft rock and reggae songs, with the
occasional pop song.</li>
<li><strong>Cluster 3</strong> (blue): This final cluster consists of
middle-high energy / high danceability songs. Examples of songs in this
cluster are some Doe Maar, Tom Misch and James Brown songs. Cluster 3
consists of upbeat reggae songs, along with some catchy (danceable)
electronic/pop songs.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is very interesting to see that the k-means algorithm has
correctly distinguished several genres: Rock (cluster 1), Soft Rock /
Reggae (cluster 2) and upbeat Reggae / Pop (cluster 3).</p>
<p>The identified clusters coincide with my taste in music a lot in a
certain way. I enjoy listening to songs in the same cluster at different
times. So where one day I might be in the mood for a lot of Chili
Peppers / Jimi Hendrix songs from cluster 1, another day I might be
looking for more down-tempo, slower rock or reggae songs like Under The
Bridge (Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Love Street (The Doors) all from
cluster 2.</p>

<p>A cepstrogram is a different kind of audio-analysis visualisation, in
which timbre features are plotted over time. These features aren’t
really well known, but we know that the c01 coefficient corresponds to
loudness, c02 to bright tones, c03 to mid range tones. After this the
coefficients get a little hard to put into words. In this case I have
chosen to split the time steps up in sections.</p>
<p>In this plot we see the cepstogram of Pompette, by Dutch band Jungle
By Night. It is an instrumental song with a lot of different
instruments. We see that a lot of the timbre coefficients are present in
this song, which is most likely due to the large amount of instruments
with different timbre, all producing very different sounds.</p>
<p>There is one very interesting part of the cepstogram, from around
220-250 seconds, in which we see most the most present timbre
coefficient jump from c01 to c02. c01 corresponds with loudness and in
this part there is a somewhat quiet percussion solo, explaining why the
c01 coefficient is less present here. The c02 coefficient corresponding
to bright tones is clear here, as the percussion instrument plays a high
tone.</p>
<p>The outro of the song is a synthesizer playing a scale repeatedly,
which also causes the timbre coefficients to switch up a bit.</p>

<p>An idea that came to me was if I could see which song is the least
danceable v.s. the song that is most danceable, and compare the two
tempograms of them. Because beat/tempo consistency is a part of the
danceability feature, I would expect the most danceable song to have a
high beat consistency (visible in a tempogram as a horizontal line),
whereas the least danceable song is expected to have a lot of tempo
variation.</p>
<p>I have decided to take the top 3 most and least danceable songs and
to take the most interesting one out of each one.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the two songs!</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Least danceable song:</strong> Voodoo Child (Slight
Return) - Jimi Hendrix</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Most danceable song:</strong> The Message - Grandmaster
Flash &amp; The Furious Five</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At a glance you can immediately see that the tempograms are very
different from each other; the tempogram of <strong>The Message</strong>
is very consistent around 100 BPM, whereas <strong>Voodoo
Child</strong>’s tempogram is all over the place, with no clear line
through it.</p>
<p>This is actually quite logical if we look at the definition of the
danceability feature: “<em>Danceability describes how suitable a track
is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including
tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value
of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</em>” The tempo in
<strong>The Message</strong> is very stable and regular and has a tempo
of 101 BPM, which is very close to <a
href="https://socialdance.stanford.edu/Syllabi/DJtips.htm">the most
danceable tempo, which is 100 bpm.</a></p>
<p>When we look at the least danceable track <strong>Voodoo
Child</strong>, we see that it doesn’t have a stable tempo, which is
most likely due to it being a very old track (little to no
pre-processing) in which the drummer probably follows Jimi Hendrix his
guitar playing which can be all over the place sometimes. The track
sounds more like a jam, in which it’s hard to stick to a certain tempo.
I do believe the generated tempogram doesn’t accurately capture the
tempo for this song, in reality the song is centered around 88 BPM and
deviates a little from this throughout the track.</p>
<p>I would say that danceability is an important factor when it comes to
my personal taste in music. I tend to gravitate towards music that has a
strong beat and rhythm (higher danceability), which is reflected in the
median danceability being 0.65.</p>

<h3>Old Playlist v.s. New Playlist</h3>
<hr />
<p>Here we see a timbre vector comparison between my new big playlist
bigmusicmountain, and my old playlist, called surf. As can be seen in
the image, my taste in music hasn’t changed a lot when comparing timbre
features. A lot of songs moved from the old playlist to the new one too,
so that might be an explanation for that.</p>
